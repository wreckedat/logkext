People ask constantly why the password doesn't work.  Like twice a day.

First, the documentation says:

```
sudo logKextClient
You will be prompted for your account password (you must be an administrator). Enter it.
Next, logKext will prompt you for your logKext password: 
logKext password:
Type in your logKext password. The default password is "logKext".
```

That's TWO DIFFERENT STEPS.  You must FIRST enter your **administrator password.**

An administrator password is the password to your OS X user account.  If you have no password, YOU MUST SET ONE (In System Preferenes).
This is a limitation of OS X and not of logKext.
